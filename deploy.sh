# Example commands (uncomment and configure these with actual project details):

# echo "Deploying Frontend to Vercel..."
# vercel deploy ./frontend --prod --name=cryptex-fxtrade-frontend

# echo "Deploying Backend to Render..."
# Note: Render often uses Git pushes for deployment, not CLI scripts directly.

echo "Deployment steps need manual configuration."
